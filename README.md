inspecting_weightspace.ipynb is the initial survey into veRSA weight distributions.

significant_features_(no)_dropout.ipynb are the files in which we got the which features are significantly weighted for predicting brain responses. Run these notebooks to get the indexes of significant features.

run_lesioned_validation.ipynb is for seeing what knocking out these significant feeatures does for model performance. Run this notebook to find out the validation scores after model lesioning. 

I worked alone on this project, so I am responsible for these files.
